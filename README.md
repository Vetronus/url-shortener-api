# URL Shortener API | NODE EXPRESS MONGODB
`version 1.2`

URL Shortner API is a simple backend code written in Node.js, Express.js and uses MongoDB to store url data. It's currently running on Heroku server and can tested on [chota.ml](https://chota.ml)

#### Please note that though this web-app is designed to be deployed on the Heroku, but you can use it on any cloud based platform. You can visit it by clicking [here](https://chota.ml).

## Language, Framework and Plugins used:
- ### Javascript
- ### Node.js
- ### Express.js
- ### Mongoose

## Features | So what exactly can it do?

If you are wondering how much functionality does it contain and how much time it can save, then here you go
- #### `Link` Model has `id`, `url` and `stamp`.
- #### Every new `link` object is given a unique numeral id.
- #### `Link` route contains all the CRUD methods to manipulate the `link` objects.

## How to use or modify this API?
- ### Download or clone this repo.
- ### Replace the `URI` var with the URI of the MongoDB database in `main.js`.
- ### Add all the extra `routes` and `models` that you want to add.
- ### Edit `main.js` to add new routes, api and web-pages.
- ### Push it to the Heroku server or any other cloud and deploy.

## Why I created this project ?
Code is repetitive. We keep writting same code over and over again in different projects. I wrote it here to help my fellow front-end developers to focus on their frontend capabilities to demonstrate their skills in a URL Shortener project for their portfolio. It will also help new comers in the backend space to understand the technologies better.

## License and Usage :

This project is completely open-source and free-to-use. But you will need to mention about its great, super awesome author XD (JK, use it anywhere you want, I really don't care.) PS, Happy Coding!
